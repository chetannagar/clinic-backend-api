## Project Overview

The Clinic Web App is designed to solve critical issues faced by clinics, including inefficient appointment scheduling, manual record-keeping, and communication gaps. By implementing a self-service appointment system, digital patient profiles, and automated reminders, we aim to improve operational efficiency and patient satisfaction.

## Features

-   **Online Appointment Booking:** Patients can easily schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments online.
-   **Automated Reminders:** Email and SMS notifications to reduce no-shows.
-   **Digital Patient Records:** Secure storage of consultation history, prescriptions, and medical reports.
-   **Doctor Dashboard:** Centralized management of appointments and patient records.
-   **Admin Panel:** Comprehensive system management and user access control.
-   **Real-time Availability:** Prevents double bookings and scheduling conflicts.
-   **Future Tele-consultation Support:** Planned integration for virtual doctor consultations.
-   **Future Online Payments:** Integration with payment gateways for convenient transactions.
